# CDO Platform Scaffold — Claude Code

@AGENTS.md

## Agent Delegation

Use agents proactively — do not wait for the user to ask:

| Trigger | Agent(s) | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| New feature / pipeline request | `planner` | Plan before coding. Identify affected scopes via `just affected`. |
| Any code written or modified | `code-reviewer` | Review immediately after changes. |
| New app, lib, or function | `tdd-guide` | Write tests first. Verify 80%+ coverage. |
| Architectural decision | `architect` | Evaluate trade-offs, produce ADR if significant. |
| Security-sensitive code (auth, grants, PII, masks) | `security-reviewer` | BLOCK commit until CRITICAL issues resolved. |
| Build or lint failure | `build-error-resolver` | Fix incrementally, verify after each fix. |
| Terraform / Unity Catalog changes | `security-reviewer` + `architect` | Both required — parallel review. |
| Python code changes | `python-reviewer` | PEP 8, type hints, PySpark idioms, ruff compliance. |
| Refactoring or dead code | `refactor-cleaner` | Identify and remove unused code safely. |

## Workflow Checklist

Before any code change:
1. `just affected` — understand blast radius
2. Read per-folder `AGENTS.md` for the directory being edited
3. For data writes: verify target table's `mask_function` if `Restricted`

Before suggesting a commit:
1. `just lint PATH && just test PATH` must pass
2. `code-reviewer` agent must approve (no CRITICAL/HIGH issues)
3. For infra: `security-reviewer` must approve

## Parallel Agent Patterns

For complex tasks, spawn agents in parallel:
- Security analysis + code review + test coverage (3 agents simultaneously)
- Architecture evaluation + performance review (2 agents simultaneously)
- Never run sequentially when agents are independent
